# Knowledge-Base-Editor
### This project is my homework at the university. It was necessary to develop an information system that, for one reason or another (the length of the car, the presence of a spoiler, etc.) will be able to classify clearly one of the types of cars (passenger car, special equipment, etc.). There is also the ability to add data, edit, delete.
